# Coding Standards and Preferences
## General Guidelines
- Use clear and descriptive variable and function names.
- Write code that is easy to read and maintain.

# Comments
- only use comments when necessary to explain complex logic.
- Avoid redundant comments that restate the code.   

# Code Structure
- Organize code into logical sections with appropriate spacing. 

# Error Handling
- Implement error handling where necessary, using try-catch blocks or similar mechanisms.   
- Ensure that error messages are clear and informative.

# Technology Stack
- C#
- whenever possible use .NET Core for cross-platform compatibility.
- you can use the context 7 mcp for information

# Testing
- Write unit tests for critical functions and components.  
- Ensure tests cover edge cases and potential failure points.

# Documentation
- Document public APIs and complex functions with clear explanations.
- Use docstrings for functions and classes to describe their purpose and usage.

# Code Style
- Follow a consistent coding style, such as PEP 8 for Python or similar standards for other languages.

# Version Control
- Use meaningful commit messages that describe the changes made.
- Commit code frequently to capture incremental changes.
- Use branches for new features or bug fixes, merging them into the main branch when complete.

# Performance
- don't optimize prematurely; focus on writing clear and correct code first.

# Security
- Be aware of common security vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection, XSS) and implement
