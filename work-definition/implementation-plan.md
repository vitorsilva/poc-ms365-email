# Implementation Plan: Office 365 Email Integration Console Application

## Overview
This plan breaks down the requirements from the PRD into small, incremental steps suitable for a junior developer. Each step includes implementation, testing, and documentation. Complete and test each step before moving to the next. The plan follows best practices for code structure, error handling, and continuous testing.

the prd is located at prd-email-integration-console.md
